As a maker at heart, I love events like [Hacksoton http://www.hacksoton.com]. It's a chance to come together with like minded people for an entire day of caffeine-fueled hacking, making and programming. Many useful tools have been made in previous years (like my [Wissues App http://wissues.net] for GitHub issue sorting) as well as lots of toys ()
