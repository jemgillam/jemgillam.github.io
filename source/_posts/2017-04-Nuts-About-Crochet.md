Three weeks ago, something very exciting began. Esther from [It's all in a Nutshell](https://itsallinanutshell.com/) launched her amazing Crochet-A-Long &quot;Nuts About Squares&quot; and the online crochet community went - well - nuts for her brilliant project. The anticipation had been huge, the wait so long, and finally we were able to get started on the first design of 12.

I had decided to use my firm yarn favourite of Stylecraft Special DK, as I knew how soft and gorgeous it already is and I didn't feel comfortable buying a new yarn from the Netherlands without already having had experience of it. One day I&apos;m sure I&apos;ll get my hands on some [Scheepjes yarn](http://www.scheepjes.com/en/yarn/) and maybe even be converted, but that day is some way in the future when I feel more confident in my crochet skills.

So I decided on following the *Nuts about Sea* colourway using the Special DK line, which as [it turns out](https://longafterthefall.wordpress.com/2016/05/03/stylecraft-the-cheaper-way-to-make-the-dancing-in-the-rain-blanket/) uses the same colour codes as Scheepjes anyway. So I looked at the colours assigned for the colour crafter yarn and used the same colour codes which gave me the following colours:

<table><tr><th>Colour</th><th>Yarn</th></tr><tr><td>A</td><td>4 x Turquoise</td></tr><tr><td>B</td><td>3 x Cloud Blue</td></tr><tr><td>C</td><td>2 x Bluebell</td><tr><tr><td>D</td><td>3 x Petrol</td></tr><tr><td>E</td><td>3 x Spring Green</td></tr><tr><td>F</td><td>2 x Parchment</td></tr></table>

Week one was a pattern by designer Dedri, of [Sophie's Universe](http://www.lookatwhatimade.net/) fame. I was delighted that we started with a designer I was already familiar with. The square took me quite a while, and by the time I had finished just one, it was time for the second.

I enjoyed the second square as well, and learnt how to make front post double treble stitches to make up the star pattern. This one was by [Helen Shrimpton](http://www.crystalsandcrochet.com/) and I enjoyed it just as much as the first. I think the front post double trebles pulled the square taught in places but hopefully this will be sorted when I block the squares.

Week three was a welcome change of pace with a pattern from [Polly Plum](http://everytrickonthehook.com/). I found it was an easier pattern to crochet, again honing those front post double treble stitches. I've made so many of those now I have managed to successfully make them without the top of the stitch being baggy.

I am now on my way to starting week four, which is a square called [Le Vesinet](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/le-vesinet-square) from designer Sigrun Hugoey and starts with nine individual circles. I've made up my first set of circles and have watched [Esther's video](https://youtu.be/TJDqwAgTJ2c) showing how to join them. I'm not used to getting my yarn needle out so early in a pattern!
