		<p>What a month it’s been! Did you see my <a href="http://jemsyarns.com/2017/04/07/An-idea-is-born-at-Hacksoton/" target="_blank" rel="external">blog post</a> about making a cool crochet app? Well, I began making that at Hacksoton on 1st April. It is now 30th April and it’s ready to launch! Woooo!</p>
<img src="/2017/04/30/Jems-Graphs-is-Here/owlexample.png" alt="Here's one of my sample images on the left, and the graph which JemsGraphs.com generates" title="Here's one of my sample images on the left, and the graph which JemsGraphs.com generates"><div class="image-caption">Here's one of my sample images on the left, and the graph which JemsGraphs.com generates</div>
<p><strong>Wait, what is it again?</strong>
<br>
I made a cool app which takes an image, and turns it into a graph. A crocheter can then use that graph to make a blanket. It’s now online at <a href="http://www.jemsgraphs.com" target="_blank" rel="external">JemsGraphs.com</a> There’s been a lot of love poured into this app, including things like a live demo right there on the home page, a painting function and a yarn shopping list.</p>
<img src="/2017/04/30/Jems-Graphs-is-Here/yarnshoppinglist.png" alt="Here's the shopping list for the owl graph, cool huh?" title="Here's the shopping list for the owl graph, cool huh?"><div class="image-caption">Here's the shopping list for the owl graph, cool huh?</div>
<p>What I really love is that I imported a list of Stylecraft yarns, and now the app uses that list to auto select a palette of colours. So basically, there’s no guessing which yarns match up to the picture as it tells you right there! I’ve also spent some time crocheting small graphs in different stitch styles. This means you can select which stitch you want and Jem’s Graphs will tell you how much of each yarn you need. It also translates that into the number of balls you’d need to buy AND how much that’ll cost. I’ve also hooked up each picture of the yarn to the relavent page on <a href="http://www.Deramores.com" target="_blank" rel="external">Deramores</a> so you can buy it if you need to. Someone who is logged in can also access a neat “Check out at Deramores” button which will fill your Deramores basket automatically!</p>

I've been a bit cheeky here, don't know how long I'll get away with this for!" title="Here's the import into the Deramores shopping basket.

<p><strong>Join my launch party</strong>
<br>
Tonight it is #CraftHour and #HandmadeHour on twitter. I am joining in with my Twitter account <a href="http://www.twitter.com/jemsyarns" target="_blank" rel="external">JemsYarns</a> and I’m going to live crochet one of the graphs from the homepage. I am looking forward to it hope to see you there!</p>

<p>As a maker at heart, I love events like <a href="http://www.hacksoton.com" target="_blank" rel="external">Hacksoton</a>. It’s a chance to come together with like minded people for an entire day of caffeine-fueled hacking, making and programming. Many useful tools have been made in previous years (like my <a href="http://wissues.net" target="_blank" rel="external">Wissues App</a> for GitHub issue sorting) as well as lots of toys (<a href="https://smt.codes/post/hacksoton-3" target="_blank" rel="external">like this</a>)</p>
<p>A couple years ago, there was one project called <a href="https://vimeo.com/127516925" target="_blank" rel="external">Spreadcam</a> by Brandon which my crafty friends and I thought would have an application for making quilt patterns. Essentially, Spreadcam takes the video feed from your webcam and turns it into a spreadsheet. We thought it was pretty cool, and wondered if we could use it to make a grid of squares for a picture quilt.</p>
<img src="/2017/04/07/An-idea-is-born-at-Hacksoton/SpreadCam.png" alt="Isn't that cool? And it was in real time too!" title="Isn't that cool? And it was in real time too!"><div class="image-caption">Isn't that cool? And it was in real time too!</div>
<p>Fast forward to 2017 and it was time for Hacksoton again. Now I crochet I had begun to think about Spreadcam again, and realised that it would also be an interesting tool to make a graphgan pattern with. I had never crocheted a graphgan style blanket before, so my first task was to make a graph the traditional pen-and-paper way and crochet a blanket from it. What better thing to crochet than the Hacksoton logo? I literally traced the logo onto graph paper, and decided which squares of the grid were to be coloured in. The process was a little difficult as the logo is very rounded but I managed to get a good pixellated version of the logo.</p>
<img src="/2017/04/07/An-idea-is-born-at-Hacksoton/hacksoton-blanket-in-progress.JPG" alt="My blanket in progress" title="My blanket in progress"><div class="image-caption">My blanket in progress</div>
<p>The actual crocheting wasn’t too difficult. I made it in the well-known corrner-to-corner style where one starts in the bottom right corner of the blanket and works in diagonal rows to the top left corner. Each pixel was made up of a ch3 and three trebles. Colour changing was easy-peasy so long as I kept to the chart. The only difficult bit was actually following the chart as working on the diagonal was confusing. You can see in the picture that I ended up crossing through each diagonal row as I went to keep track.</p>
<div class="twitter-wrapper"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/hacksoton/status/848096793795624961" target="_blank" rel="external"></a></blockquote></div><script async defer src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<p>So come the day I turned up with my blanket and laptop and got to work. While Spreadcam was the initial inspiration, I started coding from scratch as I thought it’d be better to work from a photo a user uploads. By lunchtime I had a working demo, which worked from some sample images and drew the image into a pixellated chart. After lunch, I downloaded the yarn thumbnails of Stylecraft Special DK and had the program match the picture colours to the yarn colours. This meant that suddenly, the program was using a defined palette which made things look amazing.</p>

<p>In the future I want to add a shopping list showing which yarns and how much of each to buy, plus an estimate of the cost. It would also be cool to allow the user to alter the generated image with a paint tool, and generate a written pattern to follow.</p>
<img src="/2017/04/07/An-idea-is-born-at-Hacksoton/Jem-shows-off-the-hacksoton-blanket.jpg" alt="My talk at the end of the day showing off my blanket and my app photo: Phil Dye" title="My talk at the end of the day showing off my blanket and my app photo: Phil Dye"><div class="image-caption">My talk at the end of the day showing off my blanket and my app photo: Phil Dye</div>
<p>The day was rounded out with a visit to the pub with some of our Hacksoton friends. It was at this point that the blanket really came into its own and went from cool thing I had made to a warm thing to wrap yourself in!</p>
<div class="twitter-wrapper"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/brandonhawkes/status/848287925519437826" target="_blank" rel="external"></a></blockquote></div><script async defer src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<p>All in all, another enjoyable day and I actually managed to get a project finished in a day which is unusual for me! My many thanks to the <a href="www.hacksoton.com">Hacksoton</a> team and their wonderful sponsors for supporting amateur, professional and first-time programmers in this free, supportive and exciting environment <i class="fa fa-heart"></i></p>
