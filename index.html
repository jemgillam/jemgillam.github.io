<p>Through my work with my local <a href="http://www.somakeit.org.uk" target="_blank" rel="external">Makerspace</a> I have met a wonderful woman called Michelle. She is the moderator of a large Facebook group called <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/aspergers.adventures/" target="_blank" rel="external">Asperger’s Adventures - Minecraft and Meltdowns</a>, a social group which acts as a support of Autism families. It has grown so much in the last couple of years that she now organises an annual event specifically catering for children with Autism and their families, which our Makerspace attends with our 3D printers and toys in tow. I went last year and took my crochet with me. Next thing I knew, I am hard at work crocheting their mascot named Meep Sheep.</p>
<p>Meep Sheep is based on the sheep from Minecraft, he is a square shape and is bright orange to stand out in a flock of white. He looks the other way from the sheep because he feels different (but not any less!)</p>
<p>I had a look around for patterns for cube and cuboid amigurumi and arrived at a distinct group of stitches which give a defined corner in the flat piece of crochet. By grouping a double crochet, treble and double treble together in one stitch, followed by a treble and double crochet in the next stitch you get a nice right angle suitable for making a square. The technique is a little tricky, but with practice it comes out lovely!</p>
<img src="/2017/04/14/Meet-Meep-Sheep/amigurumi-square.jpg" alt="The clusters of dc, tr and dtr stitches at the corners give a neat right angle" title="The clusters of dc, tr and dtr stitches at the corners give a neat right angle"><div class="image-caption">The clusters of dc, tr and dtr stitches at the corners give a neat right angle</div>
<p>So here is the pattern for him, he’s completely free to make but if you’re thinking of selling him please contact me as I’d prefer for the profits from his sales go into the Minecraft &amp; Meltdowns group. <a href="https://www.etsy.com/uk/shop/JemsYarns" target="_blank" rel="external">I also sell him (not-for-profit)</a>, so if you can’t crochet you can still buy one at my <a href="https://www.etsy.com/uk/shop/JemsYarns" target="_blank" rel="external">Etsy store</a>.</p>

<p></p><h3>Free Pattern: Meep Sheep</h3><p></p>
<p><strong>Pattern Notes</strong></p>
<p>Each cuboid is made in two parts. Part one starts as a flat square, you then work in the back loops only (BLO) around the edge to help grow the square from a flat shape to a cubiod with one flat square and four vertical sides. Part two is a second flat square which you then stitch onto part one to make a closed 3D shape.</p>
<p>While amigurumi is usually made in continuous rounds, because of the nature of the cuboid shape this is made in <em>joined rounds</em>. This means each round begins with a ch1 and ends with a sl st join. This keeps the corners of the cuboid well defined.</p>
<p><strong>Crochet terms</strong></p>
<p>This pattern is written in British crochet terms. Here’s what the abbreviations mean with US terms alongside.</p>
<table><tr><th>Term</th><th>UK term</th><th>US terms</th></tr><tr><td>BLO</td><td>work in the <strong>B</strong>ack <strong>L</strong>oops <strong>O</strong>nly</td><td>back loops only</td></tr><tr><td>dc</td><td>double crochet</td><td>single crochet</td></tr><tr><td>dtr</td><td>double treble crochet</td><td>treble crochet</td></tr><tr><td>ch1</td><td>chain 1</td><td>chain 3</td></tr><tr><td>sl st</td><td>slip stitch</td><td>slip stitch</td></tr><tr><td>tr</td><td>treble crochet</td><td>double crochet</td></tr></table>
<br>
<p><strong>Materials</strong></p>
<p>Orange &amp; grey acrylic yarn, craft foam sheet, toy stuffing, a small weight (eg a coin), black embroidery thread, and a hook one size smaller than you’d usually use.</p>
<p>Amigurumi is worked tightly to make sure no holes appear in the crocheted fabric. This usually means you need to use a hook one size smaller than recommended by the yarn label. EG if you use double knit like I have, you will use a 3mm hook.</p>

<p>If you make one, please send me a photo either by leaving me a comment with a link, or by finding the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/aspergers.adventures/" target="_blank" rel="external">Minecraft &amp; Meltdowns group</a> and uploading it into there. I’d love to see your creation! If you have any questions about the pattern please leave a comment below. I’ve tried my best to keep it readable, but it sometimes got tricky with so many stitches being worked into the corner stitches.</p>

<p>As a maker at heart, I love events like <a href="http://www.hacksoton.com" target="_blank" rel="external">Hacksoton</a>. It’s a chance to come together with like minded people for an entire day of caffeine-fueled hacking, making and programming. Many useful tools have been made in previous years (like my <a href="http://wissues.net" target="_blank" rel="external">Wissues App</a> for GitHub issue sorting) as well as lots of toys (<a href="https://smt.codes/post/hacksoton-3" target="_blank" rel="external">like this</a>)</p>
<p>A couple years ago, there was one project called <a href="https://vimeo.com/127516925" target="_blank" rel="external">Spreadcam</a> by Brandon which my crafty friends and I thought would have an application for making quilt patterns. Essentially, Spreadcam takes the video feed from your webcam and turns it into a spreadsheet. We thought it was pretty cool, and wondered if we could use it to make a grid of squares for a picture quilt.</p>
<img src="/2017/04/07/An-idea-is-born-at-Hacksoton/SpreadCam.png" alt="Isn't that cool? And it was in real time too!" title="Isn't that cool? And it was in real time too!"><div class="image-caption">Isn't that cool? And it was in real time too!</div>
<p>Fast forward to 2017 and it was time for Hacksoton again. Now I crochet I had begun to think about Spreadcam again, and realised that it would also be an interesting tool to make a graphgan pattern with. I had never crocheted a graphgan style blanket before, so my first task was to make a graph the traditional pen-and-paper way and crochet a blanket from it. What better thing to crochet than the Hacksoton logo? I literally traced the logo onto graph paper, and decided which squares of the grid were to be coloured in. The process was a little difficult as the logo is very rounded but I managed to get a good pixellated version of the logo.</p>
<img src="/2017/04/07/An-idea-is-born-at-Hacksoton/hacksoton-blanket-in-progress.JPG" alt="My blanket in progress" title="My blanket in progress"><div class="image-caption">My blanket in progress</div>
<p>The actual crocheting wasn’t too difficult. I made it in the well-known corrner-to-corner style where one starts in the bottom right corner of the blanket and works in diagonal rows to the top left corner. Each pixel was made up of a ch3 and three trebles. Colour changing was easy-peasy so long as I kept to the chart. The only difficult bit was actually following the chart as working on the diagonal was confusing. You can see in the picture that I ended up crossing through each diagonal row as I went to keep track.</p>
<div class="twitter-wrapper"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/hacksoton/status/848096793795624961" target="_blank" rel="external"></a></blockquote></div><script async defer src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<p>So come the day I turned up with my blanket and laptop and got to work. While Spreadcam was the initial inspiration, I started coding from scratch as I thought it’d be better to work from a photo a user uploads. By lunchtime I had a working demo, which worked from some sample images and drew the image into a pixellated chart. After lunch, I downloaded the yarn thumbnails of Stylecraft Special DK and had the program match the picture colours to the yarn colours. This meant that suddenly, the program was using a defined palette which made things look amazing.</p>

<p>In the future I want to add a shopping list showing which yarns and how much of each to buy, plus an estimate of the cost. It would also be cool to allow the user to alter the generated image with a paint tool, and generate a written pattern to follow.</p>
<img src="/2017/04/07/An-idea-is-born-at-Hacksoton/Jem-shows-off-the-hacksoton-blanket.jpg" alt="My talk at the end of the day showing off my blanket and my app photo: Phil Dye" title="My talk at the end of the day showing off my blanket and my app photo: Phil Dye"><div class="image-caption">My talk at the end of the day showing off my blanket and my app photo: Phil Dye</div>
<p>The day was rounded out with a visit to the pub with some of our Hacksoton friends. It was at this point that the blanket really came into its own and went from cool thing I had made to a warm thing to wrap yourself in!</p>

<p>All in all, another enjoyable day and I actually managed to get a project finished in a day which is unusual for me! My many thanks to the <a href="www.hacksoton.com">Hacksoton</a> team and their wonderful sponsors for supporting amateur, professional and first-time programmers in this free, supportive and exciting environment <i class="fa fa-heart"></i></p>
